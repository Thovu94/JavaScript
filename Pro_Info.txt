This is one of my first projects when I started programming. I created this website using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and then I added some PHP. 
However, you cannot see how PHP works on Github because it only supports static web page, not a dynamic website (PHP).
Because of my personal purpose, I made it for myself to use. I use 6 Jars Budgeting Method to spend money wisely.
Hope you find it useful!
